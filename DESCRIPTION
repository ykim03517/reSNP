Description: This package provides test results for association analysis between a genotyped SNP and complex traits when the underlying genetic model is unknown. An integrative association test procedure under a generalized linear model framework to flexibly model the data from the above three common genetic models (recessivie, additive, dominant) and beyond. A computationally efficient resampling procedure is adopted to compute p-values, and score-statistics based bootstrapping is used to obtain the confidence interval of estimated genetic model.
